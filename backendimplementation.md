User Management and Authentication Implementation Plan
Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a user management and authentication system for an application with three user roles: Admin, Agent, and Client. The primary focus is on security, user experience, and efficient management of user accounts.

Environment Setup
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root to store environment variables:



Manually create admin accounts in the MongoDB users collection.
Include admin email and a temporary password.
First Login Verification and Password Change:

Use SendGrid for email verification.
Use Twilio for SMS verification (if necessary).
Prompt admins to change their password on first login.
Enforce strong password requirements (8+ characters, number, uppercase, special character).
Authentication using OAuth 2.0
OAuth Setup
Library: Use Passport.js for OAuth 2.0.
Integration:
Configure Passport.js with strategies for email/password authentication.
Set up routes for login, registration, and token handling.
Password Hashing and Salting
Library: Use bcrypt for hashing passwords.
Implementation:
Use 10-12 rounds for hashing.
Ensure unique salt for each user.
Store hashes securely in MongoDB.
Email Verification
Verification Process
Email Service: Use SendGrid for sending verification emails.
Verification Flow:
Send a 6-digit code to new users.
Ensure the verification code expires after 10 minutes.
Store verification codes securely.
Code Example for Email Verification


import sendgrid from '@sendgrid/mail';

sendgrid.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

const sendVerificationEmail = async (email, code) => {
  const msg = {
    to: email,
    from: 'noreply@yourapp.com',
    subject: 'Verify your email',
    text: `Your verification code is ${code}`,
  };
  await sendgrid.send(msg);
};
User Management Interface for Admins
Features
Admin Interface:

Visualize users and their details.
View registration requests.
Manage user accounts (change agent/client matching, delete/disable accounts).
Log all actions for auditing.
Search and Filtering:

Implement robust search and filtering options for ease of use.
Implementation Example


import express from 'express';
import { User } from '../models/User';

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const users = await User.find();
    res.json(users);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: err.message });
  }
});

router.post('/users/:id/match', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findById(req.params.id);
    user.agentId = req.body.agentId;
    await user.save();
    res.json(user);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: err.message });
  }
});

export default router;
Security Considerations
Rate Limiting
Library: Use express-rate-limit.
Configuration:
Limit requests per IP address to prevent abuse.
Example configuration:


const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.'
});
app.use('/api/', limiter);
HTTPS and E2E Encryption
HTTPS: Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates.
E2E Encryption: Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data.
Use libraries like crypto-js for client-side encryption.
Ensure all data is transmitted over HTTPS.
Implementation Details
Backend Routes
Agents Route: Reads from REACT_APP_AGENT_DETAILS_FILE_PATH.
Clients Route: Reads from REACT_APP_CLIENT_DETAILS_FILE_PATH.
Movements Route: Reads from REACT_APP_JSON_FILE_PATH.
Example Backend Route


import express from 'express';
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/agents', (req, res) => {
  const filePath = process.env.REACT_APP_AGENT_DETAILS_FILE_PATH;
  fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(500).json({ message: err.message });
    }
    res.json(JSON.parse(data));
  });
});

export default router;
Password Management
Use bcrypt with 10-12 rounds for hashing passwords.
Ensure unique salt for each user.
Email Service Setup
Use SendGrid for sending verification emails.
OAuth Setup
Use Passport.js for handling OAuth authentication.
Conclusion
Following this plan will ensure a secure and efficient user management and authentication system, with a focus on usability and security. By leveraging robust libraries and services, the implementation will provide a seamless experience for users while maintaining high security standards.
